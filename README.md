The «Basic High-Performance Computing course» aims at teaching to master students the foundations of HPC:

- **modern CPU and single-node architecture**
  Memory hierarchy, branch prediction and out-of-order execution: putting all together to write an efficient serial code that exploits the potential delivered by Instruction- and Data- level parallelism
  Slides, lecture notes, additional notes and example codes in the folder [`./Single-Core_Optimization`](./Single-Core_Optimization).
- **shared-memory parallelism** 
  Multi-threading with OpenMP (intermediate level)
  Slides, lecture notes, additional notes and example codes in the folder [`./OpenMP`](./OpenMP).
- **architecture of an HPC cluster**
  From nodes to network and storage
  Slides in the folder [`./MPI`](./MPI).
- **distributed-memory parallelism** 
  MPI at intermediate level: p2p blocking and non-blocking, collectives, I/O, groups&communicators
  Slides, lecture notes, additional notes and example codes in the folder [`./MPI`](./MPI).
- **debugging & profiling** serial and parallel codes
  Slides, lecture notes, additional notes and example codes in the folder [`./Debugging and Profiling`](./Debugging_and_Profiling).
